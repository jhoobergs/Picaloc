# Picaloc

Picaloc is a location based social media app which allows it's users to broadcast messages, primarily photo's, across a certain range. The range depends on the ranking of the user which is based on the number of likes on previous posts. 

## short description
All posts are done by smartphone, in this case through an Android app. It's also possible to get an overview of all posts at a certain location via an angular based webapp (https://picaloc-2acb6.firebaseapp.com/) The Android app uses features of firebase like authentication, file upload, push notifications, hosting, analytics and crash report. Computations are executed in an Ruby on Rails backend.

## about us
We are three computer engineering students from the KU Leuven university in Belgium. This was our first hackaton and it was an awesome experience. We're also developers at Quivr(.be), a non profit student organisation in Belgium which let students check their schedule, what they can eat in the student restaurants, how much place there is left in the libraries and much more.
