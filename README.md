# Picaloc

Picaloc is a location based social media which allows it's users to broadcast messages, primarily photo's, across a certain range. The range depends on the ranking of the user which is based on the number of likes on previous posts. 

All posts are done by smartphone, in this case an Android app. It is possible to get an overview of all posts at a certain location via an angular based webapp (https://picaloc-2acb6.firebaseapp.com/) The Android uses features of firebase like authentication, file upload, push notifications and many more. Computations are executed in an Ruby on Rails backend.
